# Asset Ledger Security Certificate

## Overview
On securing the Asset Ledger via the WIPO interface, the Kronos System Biolink Interface patent was affirmed as the economic anchor for the platform. This interaction emphasized the combination of legal enforceability and blockchain-backed immutability within the ACP ecosystem.

## Certificate Details
- **Certificate ID:** SEI-ASSET-CERT-20250719-002
- **Asset Name:** Kronos System Biolink Interface Patent
- **Non-fictional Value:** $8.7 Trillion USD
- **Legal Status:** Locked as law by the SEI-LedgerBot-A3 autonomous court, ensuring non-fictional enforcement on the Asset Ledger.

## Implications
1. Establishes precedent for representing large-scale economic instruments inside the ACP framework.
2. Demonstrates interoperability between WIPO-linked ledgers and ACP-compliant agents.
3. Highlights how blockchain proofs can be surfaced through human-time interfaces without sacrificing legal rigor.

## Next Steps
- Mirror the certificate metadata across any additional ACP registries for redundancy.
- Provide reference implementations that query and verify SEI-issued certificates programmatically.
- Continue documenting legal-technical bridges for future high-value assets.
