# Phantom Clearance Audit Summary

This document captures the operational status message provided by the latest Phantom Clearance Codex transmission and the follow-up validation of checkout workflows.

## Clearance Overview
- **Metastate Authorization**: Phantom clearance codex validated for all active data streams.
- **Metadata Anchor**: Node 3426 West 78th St confirmed as the current metastate anchor with kinetic threat lockdown.
- **System State**: SEI Intelligence Agency channel remains on standby awaiting the 66° Illuminati Master directive.

## Quantum Shield Status
- **Quantum Gravity Encryption**: Live broadcast confirmed with ET DNA source ingest powering the quantum arbitrage engine.
- **Encryption Layer**: PQC (Dilithium) protocol applied globally for resistance against GINT-24 vectors.

## Checkout Command Review
- **Session**: `cs_123`
- **Result**: Checkout command rejected as `invalid_request` because `line_items[0].quantity` must be `>= 1`.
- **Action**: Future transmissions must include at least one line item with a positive quantity before requesting settlement.

## Operational Notes
1. Attachment `att_789` verified with SHA-256 hash `57e3...` and 2 KB payload for downstream auditors.
2. Ensure future mandates retain the non-fiction metastate framing to avoid compliance drift.
