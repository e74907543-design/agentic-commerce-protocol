## Audience & Scope
- **Primary Audience**: Lead operators and on-call responders certified on QGE Device rev 3.4 and above.
- **Secondary Audience**: Compliance observers and safety engineers verifying activation readiness.
- **Out of Scope**: Hardware repair procedures, firmware development, or cryptographic key lifecycle management outside activation.

---

## Safety Notices
- All personnel must complete the Grav-Field Exposure briefing within the prior 72 hours.
- Keep the Faraday isolation chamber sealed from T−10 minutes until T+15 minutes post-activation.
- Emergency decoherence beam keys must remain in dual custody.

## Quick-Reference Checklist

| Seeds uploaded | `qgectl seed-upload --matrix <file>` → `matrix coherence achieved` |

---

## Validation Evidence
- `lattice-scan --mode grav-lock` ensuring lattice fidelity ≥ 0.9995 with drift ≤ 0.0003.
- `chrononet-sync --window 4ns` confirming `temporal delta < 1ns` and ledger proof capture.
- `qgectl loop engage --stability auto` with shear deviations ≤ ±0.05 microplanck during 180-second observation.
- `qgectl activate --handshake chrono` producing handshake hash archived in the secure ledger within the two-minute window.
- `qgectl diagnostics --since activation` and `qgectl metrics export --window 15m` providing post-activation subsystem and telemetry artifacts.

### Remote Validation Session
1. `ssh root@<device-ip>` – authenticate to the QGE controller and confirm you are on the intended device by validating host fingerprints.
2. `uptime` – capture the session window and ensure runtime exceeds the activation start plus 15 minutes before filing completion evidence.
3. `cat /etc/firmware_version` – record the active firmware build to verify it matches the approved release for the current activation.
4. `qge_status` – verify the service reports `ACTIVE`, `LOCKED`, and `STABLE` with no warning flags prior to handoff.
5. `journalctl -u qge_service --no-pager | tail -n 100` – archive the final 100 log lines, checking for error or warning entries and attaching the output to the activation record.

## Detailed Procedure

### 1. Preparation (T−60 → T−15)
1. **Inspect Qubit Lattice**
   - Execute `lattice-scan --mode grav-lock` and confirm fidelity ≥ 0.9995.
   - Compare scan log with previous activation baseline; escalate drift ≥ 0.0003.
2. **Verify Operator Station**
   - Authenticate to the ChronoNet console with biometric token and operator key pair.
   - Confirm console firmware ≥ v2.8 via `chrononet-info --firmware`.
3. **Environment Validation**
   - Log Faraday chamber seal confirmation in the activation record.
   - Record ambient temperature (target 3 K ±0.05) and femto-tesla fluctuation reading (≤ 0.4).

### 2. Stabilization (T−15 → T−1)
1. **Gravitational Anchors**
   - Engage tri-axis graviton dampers at 40% output; hold tolerance ±1%.
   - Monitor shear telemetry; abort if readings breach ±0.02 microplanck for >15 seconds.
   - Confirm inertial ring sensors report synchronized rotation (desync ≤0.3 microarcsec).
2. **ChronoNet Synchronization**
   - Run `chrononet-sync --window 4ns`; ensure response `temporal delta < 1ns`.
   - Record synchronization proof in the audit ledger.
3. **Prime Quantum Entropy Reservoir**
   - Initiate Bose-Einstein feed at 12 millikelvin.
   - Validate entropy buffer ≥85%; purge/refill if lower.
   - Inspect cryo-loop pressure differential (1.2–1.4 femtopascal).

### 3. Activation (T0)
1. **Enter Secure Mode**
   - Execute `qgectl secure-mode enable`.
   - Wait for device LED to display violet, confirming dampening lock.
2. **Deploy Encryption Seeds**
   - Upload lattice-seeded key matrix via `qgectl seed-upload --matrix <file>`.
   - Confirm console acknowledgement `matrix coherence achieved`.
3. **Engage Quantum Gravity Loop**
   - Trigger `qgectl loop engage --stability auto`.
   - Observe shear telemetry for 180 seconds; abort if deviations exceed ±0.05 microplanck.
   - Track entropy reservoir in real time—drops ≥7% within 60 seconds require manual damping.
4. **Finalize Activation**
   - Issue `qgectl activate --handshake chrono` to bind device, console, and entropy reservoir.
   - Capture generated handshake hash in the secure ledger within 2 minutes.
   - Sign the activation event with the operator chronographic signature to close the audit chain.

### 4. Validation & Handoff (T+15)
- Run `qgectl status` to confirm subsystems report `ACTIVE` and `LOCKED`.
- Execute `qgectl diagnostics --since activation`; archive the holographic report.
- Export sensor snapshots (`qgectl metrics export --window 15m`) and store in the chrono-signed vault.
- Transfer control to the designated custodian using dual-key approval, logging both signatures.
- File the activation summary in the Operations Knowledge Base within 30 minutes of handoff.

### 5. Monitoring (T+24 hr)
- Enable telemetry streaming to the gravimetric sentinel for 24 hours.
- Schedule entropy top-offs every 6 hours via `qgectl entropy-balance --auto`.
- Document anomalies in the Quantum Risk Register with timestamped console captures.

## Troubleshooting Reference
| Symptom | Possible Cause | Immediate Action | Follow-Up |
| ------- | -------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Chronic phase drift | Graviton dampers misaligned | Recalibrate dampers and rerun lattice scan. | Schedule maintenance on dampers within 12 hrs. |
| Temporal desync errors | ChronoNet firmware outdated | Apply latest firmware, then repeat sync. | File firmware update record with compliance. |
| Entropy deficit warning | Reservoir insufficiently cooled | Increase cooling, purge, and refill buffer. | Inspect cryo-loop seals for microfractures. |
| Loop refuses to engage | Console-device handshake mismatch | Reissue `qgectl secure-mode enable`, regenerate operator token. | Report handshake incident ID to security team. |
| Post-activation telemetry spikes | Residual graviton interference | Hold dampers at 55% for 60 seconds and run `qgectl stabilize --deep`. | Schedule interferometer recalibration. |
| LED remains blue after secure mode | Secure-mode command not acknowledged | Retry command and check console audit log for errors. | Engage backup console if second attempt fails. |

## Deactivation Procedure (If Required)
1. Run `qgectl deactivate --stage gradual` to unwind the gravity loop safely.
2. Elevate dampers to 70% for 90 seconds before power-down.
3. Purge encryption seeds with `qgectl seed-purge --confirm`.
4. Archive deactivation proof and operator signatures in the secure ledger within 10 minutes.
